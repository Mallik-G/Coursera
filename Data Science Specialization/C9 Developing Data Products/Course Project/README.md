# Developing Data Products
### Course Project: README


### Introduction
This repository holds the results for the Coursera Course Project: Developing Data Products. This assessment required the student to pick any dataset and produce a web application hosted via the SaaS platform from RStudio shinyapss.io. In addition, the student was also required to prepare a reproducible pitch presention using slidify or Rstudio Presenter.

The dataset and web application selected for this project are based on the Kaggle Titanic Challenge: [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)


### Titanic Challenge
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. 


### Data
The datasets were obtained from the Kaggle Titanic Challenge: [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

* Training Dataset: [training data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/download/train.csv)
* Testing Dataset: [test data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/download/test.csv)


### 1. Web Application
For the web application component of this project, I chose to develop an interactive environment for basic exploratory data analysis. The environment provides a user interface to manipulate a ggplot based chart. Dynamic chart elements include the type of chart (e.g. histrogram, scatter etc.), varible sample size, which dataset fields are to be assigned to each axis, and finally, which dataset field is to be used to categorize displayed data. The Kaggle Titanic dataset was used during development of this web application.

The appplication is hosted via the SaaS platform from RStudio shinyapss.io and can be accessed here: [Shiny page](https://buswedg.shinyapps.io/DDPCP1)


### 2. Reproducible Pitch Presentation
For the reproducible pitch presentation, I prepared a short slidedeck which pitches the above web application as an idea (i.e. outlining the intention, method and benefits.)

The pitch presentation was prepared using Slidify and has been published on Rpubs here: [Rpubs page](http://rpubs.com/buswedg/100724)
