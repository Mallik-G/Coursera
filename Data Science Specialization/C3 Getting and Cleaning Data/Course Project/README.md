Describes variables, data, and transformations made in order to generate tidy data. 

- **run_analysis.R:**
R script which generates tidy data.

&nbsp;


#### Instructions

1. Download/clone contents of project directory

2. Open run_analysis.R within R-Studio

3. Set working directory to location of run_analysis.R script

4. Execute run_analysis.R script

5. Tidy data set 'data_sensor_avgactsub.txt' will be generated within working directory

Please see Code Book.md for further explanation of process [1].
