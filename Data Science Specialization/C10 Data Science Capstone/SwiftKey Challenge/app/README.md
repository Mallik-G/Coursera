# Data Science Capstone
### Course Project: README

### 1. Introduction
This repository holds the results for the Coursera course: Data Science Capstone. This assessment required the student to apply data science techniques in the area of natural language processing by building a predictive text application. The application is to be capable of scanning a stream of text as it is typed by a user and suggest possibilities for the next word to be appended to the input stream. The application is to be demonstrated via the Shiny platform, which will allow users to type an input text stream and receive a text predictions within a web based environment.


### 2. Data
This assessment makes use of raw text data from three sources (news headlines, blog entries, and user tweets). Datasets were made available in German, Russian and English, however only the English datasets were utilized as part of this project.

### 3. Application
The application is to be capable of scanning a stream of text as it is typed by a user and suggest possibilities for the next word to be appended to the input stream. The application is to be demonstrated via the Shiny platform, which will allow users to type an input text stream and receive a text predictions within a web based environment.

* The appplication is hosted via the SaaS platform from RStudio shinyapss.io and can be accessed here: [Shiny page](https://buswedg.shinyapps.io/DSCapstone)


### 4. Pitch Presentation
For the pitch presentation, I prepared a short slidedeck which pitches the above application.

* The pitch presentation was prepared using Slidify and has been published on Rpubs here: [Rpubs page](http://rpubs.com/buswedg/146631)
